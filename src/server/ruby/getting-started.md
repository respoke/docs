### Ruby Library
# Getting Started

## Overview

The Respoke Ruby Library provides a convenient way for Node developers to interface with Respoke for
non-browser-to-browser communication tasks. Good examples of non-browser-to-browser communication tasks include
authentication.

First validate you have Ruby 2.1.* or greater installed.

## Install Respoke Ruby

Install Respoke as a local application dependency using [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/):

    gem install respoke

## Create Respoke

Finally, create an instance of Respoke:

    require "respoke"

    client = Respoke::Client.new(app_secret: "eb327e57-e766-49de-b801-ef612a70509e")

That's it! Now we're ready to start using all this Respoke server library has to offer.
