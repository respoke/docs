### PHP Library
# Getting Started

## Overview

The Respoke PHP Library provides a convenient way for PHP developers to interface with Respoke for
non-browser-to-browser communication tasks. Good examples of non-browser-to-browser communication tasks include
authentication.

First validate you have PHP 5.4.* or greater installed.

## Install Respoke PHP

Install Respoke as a local application dependency using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require respoke/respoke

## Create Respoke

Finally, create an instance of Respoke:

    use Respoke\Client;

    $client = new Respoke\Client();

That's it! Now we're ready to start using all this Respoke server library has to offer.
