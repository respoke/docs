### Node.js Library
# Getting Started

## Overview

The Respoke Node.js Library provides a convenient way for Node developers to interface with Respoke for
non-browser-to-browser communication tasks. Good examples of non-browser-to-browser communication tasks include
authentication.

## Install Respoke Node.js

Install Respoke as a local application dependency using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm install respoke-admin

## Create Respoke

Finally, create an instance of Respoke:

    // Require Respoke
    var Respoke = require('respoke-admin');

    // Create an instance of the Respoke
    var respoke = new Respoke({
        appId: "c10a2075-3f3d-466f-82f9-d2285e64c5d4",
        "App-Secret": "eb327e57-e766-49de-b801-ef612a70509e"
    });

That's it! Now we're ready to start using all this Respoke server library has to offer.
