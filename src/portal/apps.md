### Respoke Dashboard

# Apps
Apps in Respoke act as containers which house the user permissions and other configuration settings for a specific application. This allows you to create multiple applications each with unique settings and permissions. You create and manage your apps in the <a href="https://portal.respoke.io/#/apps" target="_blank">Apps tab of the Dev Portal</a>.

## Creating an App
To create a new Respoke app head to the <a href="https://portal.respoke.io/#/apps" target="_blank">Apps tab of the Dev Portal</a> and click the `New App button`. Provide a name and description for your app and click Ok.
