# Changelog

## 2014-09-02

**Analytics** Or, as we affectionately call it here at Respoke Central,
Babylitics. After your app gets some traffic, you'll see maps and charts on your
[dashboard][], this includes US Usage, World Usage, a breakdown of User Agents,
and a codecs breakdown. We are just getting started, so expect to see more
analytics soon!
